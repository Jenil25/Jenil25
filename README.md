### 📊 My GitHub Stats

(These stats are fine to keep, but I recommend removing the "Most Used Languages" card as it doesn't reflect your professional Python/AI experience)

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Jenil25&layout=compact&theme=radical) ```

This new README now aligns perfectly with your resume and tells a strong, cohesive story to recruiters.

Would you like help drafting the detailed "case study" README for your professional LLM project?
